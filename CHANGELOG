== 3.2.0 2016-08-XX

 * Support for MRI 2.3.0.

== 3.1.1 2016-08-02

 * Prevent installation on ruby 2.3, as compilation fails. Sorry! [Mathieu Jobin]

== 3.1.0 2015-02-06

 * Fix performance issue caused by fix for pry. You'll need to use
   Looksee.rename to use the pry "ls" command.

== 3.0.1 2015-01-24

 * Fix Looksee.rename. [Jan Lelis]
 * Object.respond_to_missing?(:ls) is now true.

== 3.0.0 2015-01-06

 * Support for MRI 2.2.0.
 * Work with pry.
 * Remove wirble support.

== 2.1.1 2014-07-13

 * Fix error for objects with an unnamed module in the lookup path.
 * Fix editing for included methods.

== 2.1.0 2014-03-05

 * Add alternative syntax: Looksee[object, *args]. Useful for BasicObject
   instances, and proxies which delegate #ls via method_missing.
 * Fix display of origin classes (used when modules are prepended).

== 2.0.0 2014-01-01

 * Support for MRI 2.1, JRuby 1.7, Rubinius 2.2.
 * Looksee now only adds #ls to Object. The old way would frequently conflict
   with, e.g., Rails controller conventions.

   - object.edit is now object.ls.edit.
   - Looksee.rename now just takes the new name for :ls.
   - The LOOKSEE_METHODS env var is now LOOKSEE_METHOD, and is simply the new
     name for :ls.
 * Raise informative errors when #edit fails (e.g., for methods without a source
   location).

== 1.1.0 2013-03-22

 * Support for MRI 2.0.0.
 * Support for MRI 1.9.3 with funnyfalcon's patches.
 * Fix listing methods of a class with an undefined allocator (e.g. Struct).
 * Updated supported rubies in README.

== 1.0.3 2011-09-05

 * MRI 1.9.3 support.

== 1.0.2 2011-03-27

 * Fix JRuby extension name for case-sensitive filesystems.

== 1.0.1 2011-03-15

 * Fix bug exception when trying to edit a primitive method on MRI.
 * Allow customizing the method names added to every object. Either:
   * Call Looksee.rename(:ls => new_name, :edit => new_name)
   * Set LOOKSEE_METHODS='ls=new_name edit=new_name' in your environment.

== 1.0.0 2011-03-09

 * New API.
   * old: lp(object, :private => true, :undefined => false).grep(/blah/)
   * new: object.ls :private, :noundefined, /blah/
 * Configuration has changed accordingly.
   * old: Looksee.default_lookup_path_options = {:private => true, :undefined => false}
   * new: Looksee.default_specifiers = [:private, :noundefined]
 * Require 'looksee' instead of 'looksee/shortcuts'. For
   non-pollutiness, use "require 'looksee/clean'".
 * All methods are now listed by default.
 * Modules are now listed root class first.
 * Support for Ruby MRI 1.9, JRuby, and Rubinius.
 * Add Object#edit(METHOD), to open Object#METHOD in your text editor.
